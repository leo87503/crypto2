# Historical Cryptocurrency Prices for Active and Delisted Tokens!

This is a modification of the original `crypto` package by [jesse vent](https://github.com/JesseVent/crypto). It is entirely set up to use means from the `tidyverse` and provides `tibble`s with all data available via the web-api of [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). **It does not require an API key but in turn only provides information that is also available through the website of [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/).**

It allows the user to retrieve

- `crypto_list()` a list of all coins that are listed as either being *active*, *delisted* or *untracked* according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyMap)
- `crypto_info()` a list of all information available for all available coins according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyInfo)
- `crypto_history()` the **most powerful** function of this package that allows to download the entire available history for all coins covered by CMC according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyOhlcvHistorical)
- `fiat_list()` a mapping of all fiat currencies (plus precious metals) available via the [CMC WEB API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1FiatMap)
- `exchange_list()` a list of all exchanges available as either being *active*, *delisted* or *untracked* according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1ExchangeMap)
- `exchange_info()` a list of all information available for all given exchanges according to the [CMC API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1ExchangeInfo)

# Update

Since version 1.4.0 the package has been reworked to retrieve as many assets as possible with one api call, as there is a new "feature" introduced by CMC to send back the initially requested data for each api call within 60 seconds. So one needs to wait 60s before calling the api again.

## Installation

You can install `crypto2` from CRAN with 
```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("crypto2")
```
or directly from github with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sstoeckl/crypto2")
```

## Package Contribution

The package provides API free and efficient access to all information from <https://coinmarketcap.com> that is also available through their website. It uses a variety of modification and web-scraping tools from the `tidyverse` (especially `purrr`).

As this provides access not only to **active** coins but also to those that have now been **delisted** and also those that are categorized as **untracked**, including historical pricing information, this package provides a valid basis for any **Asset Pricing Studies** based on crypto currencies that require **survivorship-bias-free** information. In addition to that, the package maintainer is currently working on also providing **delisting returns** (similarly to CRSP for stocks) to also eliminate the **delisting bias**.

## Package Usage

First we load the `crypto2`-package and download the set of active coins from <https://coinmarketcap.com> (additionally one could load delisted coins with `only_Active=FALSE` as well as untracked coins with `add_untracked=TRUE`).

```{r example}
library(crypto2)
library(dplyr)

# List all active coins
coins <- crypto_list(only_active=TRUE)
```

Next we download information on the first three coins from that list.

```{r example-info}
# retrieve information for all (the first 3) of those coins
coin_info <- crypto_info(coins,limit=3)

# and give the first two lines of information per coin
coin_info
```

In a next step we show the logos of the three coins as provided by <https://coinmarketcap.com>.

```{r logos, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', out.width = '5%',out.height='5%'}
coin_info$logo %>% knitr::include_graphics(.)
```

In addition we show tags provided by <https://coinmarketcap.com>.

```{r tags}
coin_info %>% select(slug,tags) %>% tidyr::unnest(tags) %>% group_by(slug) %>% slice(1,n())
```

Additionally: Here are some urls pertaining to these coins as provided by <https://coinmarketcap.com>.

```{r urls}
coin_info %>% select(slug,urls) %>% tidyr::unnest(urls) %>% filter(name %in% c("reddit","twitter"))
```

In a next step we download time series data for these coins.

```{r history}
# retrieve historical data for all (the first 3) of them
coin_hist <- crypto_history(coins, limit=3, start_date="20210101", end_date="20210105")

# and give the first two times of information per coin
coin_hist %>% group_by(slug) %>% slice(1:2)
```

Alternatively, we could determine the price of these coins in other currencies. A list of such currencies is available as `fiat_list()`

```{r fiat}
fiats <- fiat_list()
fiats
```

So we download the time series again depicting prices in terms of Bitcoin and Euro (note that multiple currencies can be given to `convert`, separated by ",").

```{r history2}
# retrieve historical data for all (the first 3) of them
coin_hist2 <- crypto_history(coins, convert="BTC,EUR", limit=3, start_date="20210101", end_date="20210105")

# and give the first two times of information per coin
coin_hist2 %>% group_by(slug,ref_cur) %>% slice(1:2)
```

Last and least, one can get information on exchanges. For this download a list of active/inactive/untracked exchanges using `exchange_list()`:

```{r exchanges}
exchanges <- exchange_list(only_active=TRUE)
exchanges
```

and then download information on "binance" and "kraken":

```{r exchange-info}
ex_info <- exchange_info(exchanges %>% filter(slug %in% c('binance','kraken')))
ex_info
```

Then we can access information on the fee structure,

```{r fee}
ex_info %>% select(contains("fee"))
```

the amount of cryptocurrencies being traded (in USD)

```{r usd-vol}
ex_info %>% select(contains("spot"))
```
or the fiat currencies allowed:

```{r ex-fiat}
ex_info %>% select(slug,fiats) %>% tidyr::unnest(fiats)
```
